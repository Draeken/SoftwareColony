## Project creation

Who can start a new project ? Should it be reserved to contributors ? What are the personal outcomes of project creation ? Does it grant more power over the project ? Why should someone wants to create a project ?

There is a pool of product idea, contributors (> 0) can vote. Could be like the BFP baking system (but allowing multiple projects in progress).
One contributor (> 1) create a project (from pool). There can't be multiple project for the same idea (it would divise resources).

## Project lifecycle

Onboarding when a project start is easy, but who will maintain it after it's finished ? Wikipedia articles have to face the same issue. How do they manage it ?
There should be colony-wide principles shared across projects to avoid having different direction/strategy that are dispute-prone.
How these principles are created/updated ?

## Resource allocation

Is there a need to limit number of contributors to a project ?
What kind of task are allowed ? How to set correct work
Who create tasks ? How to manage funds & pots ? How to match people and task's needs (manager, evaluator, worker) ?
Have a pool of human resources available for this project (that they accept to join). When people join a project, they choose what kind of role they are opened to. Have a way to measure the relevance with user's skills (at task assignation, relative to other resources available).

What is the cost for changing asignee ?

## Decision

How decision are made ? How disputes are resolved ?
