There is a pool of product idea, contributors (> 0) can vote.
One contributor (> 1) create a project (from pool). There can't be multiple project for the same idea (it would divise resources).

## Resource allocation

Is there a need to limit number of contributors to a project ?
What kind of task are allowed ? Corresponding to what amount of work ?
Who create tasks ? How to manage funds & pots ? How to match people and task's needs (manager, evaluator, worker) ?
Have a pool of human resources available for this project (that they accept to join). When people join a project, they choose what kind of role they are opened to. Have a way to measure the relevance with user's skills (at task assignation, relative to other resources available).

What is the cost for changing asignee ?
